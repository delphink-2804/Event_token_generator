# Event_token_generator
📌 **Overview**
- The Event Token Generator System is a secure authentication mechanism designed to generate unique, time-sensitive tokens for event-based access. It ensures that only authorized users can participate in an event by providing event-specific tokens that automatically expire after a defined duration.

🔥 **Features**
- Unique Token Generation: Generates distinct, non-reusable tokens for each event/session.

- Time-Based Expiry: Ensures that tokens remain valid only for a specific duration.

- User Authentication: Links each token to a user ID for secure access control.

- Multi-Platform Usage: Suitable for both physical and virtual event authentication.

- Event Logging & Tracking: Maintains records of token usage for audit and review.

🛠 **Tech Stack**
- Backend: Node.js

- Frontend: React.js / HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Database: MongoDB

- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)

🚀 **Installation & Setup**
- To set up and run the project locally:

- Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

- Install dependencies required for both the backend and frontend.

- Configure environment variables by setting the database URL, secret key, and token expiry duration.

- Run the backend server to handle API requests.

- Start the frontend to serve the application.

📌 **Usage**
